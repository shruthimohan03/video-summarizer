            "  - in text processing if we face this problem in nearly every simple task that we are doing.\n",
            "  - i ask you this question do you have the same problem in other languages hindi?\n",
            "  - this problem you will see is again language dependent.\n",
            "  - this problem is there for english but not for hindi but we will see there are other problems that do not exist for english language but are there for other indian language.\n",
            "  - what happens if i am taking a language chinese or japanese.\n",
            "  - same problem happens with japanese and you have further complications because they are using four different scripts katakana hiragana kanjana rumanji.\n",
            "  - the same problem is there even for sanskrit.\n",
            "  - if some of you have taken sanskrit course in your class 8th or 10th.\n",
            "  - you might be familiar with the rules of sanskrit language.\n",
            "  - let us say this is a simple single sentence in sanskrit but this is a huge this looks a simple word but it is not a single word.\n",
            "  - it is composed of multiple words in sanskrit and they are combined with this sandhi relation.\n",
            "  - this stands for a nice proverb in sanskrit that translation english as one should tell the truth one should say kind words one should neither tell harsh truth not flatly flattening lies this is a rule for all times.\n",
            "  - this problem is in chinese japanese and sanskrit but in sanskrit the problem is slightly more complicated and why is that?\n",
            "  - it does not happen in sanskrit.\n",
            "  - you see here the letter t gets changed to n.   when i am trying to analyze the sentence this purpose sentence in sanskrit i need to find out not only what are the breaks but what is the corresponding word from which this sentence is .\n",
            "  - from here i have to find out the actual words are briyath plus na that gives me this briyana and this is very very common in sanskrit that you are always combining words by doing sanda operation.\n",
            "  - you see in sanskrit the longest word is composed of 431 characters it is the compound and you have greek and african and other languages.\n",
            "  - what is the particular word in sanskrit composed of 431 letters.\n",
            "  - when i talk about this problem of tokenization in sanskrit or in english this problem is also called word segmentation.\n",
            "  - when i talk about sanskrit this we have a segment are available at the site sanskrit.ng.fr.\n",
            "  - we will see what is the design principle of building a segment or in sanskrit.\n",
            "  - first we have a generative model that says how do i generate a sentence in sanskrit?\n",
            "  - i have a finite alphabet sigma a set of various characters in sanskrit.\n",

            "  - i am talking about the language english can you always say that wherever i have a dot it is the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - there are many ways in which i can end my sentence.\n",
            "  - i can have exclamation or question mark that ends the sentence and they are mostly an ambiguous.\n",
            "  - whenever i have a exclamation or question mark i can say probably this is the end of the sentence but is the case the same with a dot.\n",
            "  - can you think of a scenario where i have a dot in english and but it is not the end of sentence.\n",
            "  - you can find all sorts of abbreviations they end with a period.\n",
            "  - you have three dots here.\n",
            "  - you cannot call each of the this as the end of your sentence.\n",
            "  - the problem of deciding whether a particular dot is the end of the sentence or not is not entirely trivial.\n",
            "  - i need to build certain algorithm for finding out is it my end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - even if it looks at trivial task we face this problem that can i always call dot as the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - whenever i see a dot or question mark or exclamation i always have to decide one of the two things.\n",
            "  - is it the end of the sentence or is it not the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - there are two classes end of the sentence or not end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - for each dot or for every word i need to decide whether this is the end of the sentence or not the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - i am at a particular word i want to decide whether this is the end of the sentence or not.\n",
            "  - i am at a word and the first thing i check is are there lots of blank lines after me?\n",
            "  - this would happen in a text whenever this is the end of the paragraph and there are some blank lines.\n",
            "  - if i feel that there are a lot of blank lines after me  after this word i may say this might be the end of the sentence with a good confidence.\n",
            "  - but they are not a lot of blank lines i will check if the final punctuation is equation mark or explanation or equivalent in that case.\n",
            "  - it is not i will check if the final punctuation is a period.\n",
            "  - if it is a period if it is not a period it is easy to say that this is not the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - again i cannot say for certain if it is the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - i will again check for simplicity i might have a list of abbreviations and i can check if the word that i am currently facing is one of the abbreviations in my list.\n",
            "  - if it is here i am accept or any other abbreviation if the answer is yes i am not an order sentence.\n",
            "  - if the answer is no  this word is not an abbreviation and this will be the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - i see the word ending with dot.\n",
            "  - let us see i have here i am here and my word is 4.3.  i am at dot i want to find out if it is the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - if i can say that the previous the current word is a number it is a high probability that this will be in number and it will not be the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - again by feature you can think of a simple rule whether the word i am currently at is a number or i can use the fact where the case of the word with dot is uppercase or lowercase.\n",
            "  - what happens generally in abbreviations?\n",
            "  - we are mostly in uppercase.\n",
            "  - i have doctor and it starts with an uppercase i can say that this might be an abbreviation.\n",
            "  - same with lowercase lowercase will give me more probability that this is not an abbreviation.\n",
            "  - similarly i can also use the case of the word after dot.\n",
            "  - is it uppercase lowercase capital or number.\n",
            "  - again whenever i have the end of the sentence the next word starts with a capital.\n",
            "  - what is the length of the word ending with dot?\n",
            "  - is it if the length is small it might be an abbreviation if the length is larger it might not be an abbreviation.\n",
            "  - and i can also use probably the what is the probability that the word ending with dot occurs at the end of the sentence.\n",
            "  - if it is really the end of the sentence it might happen that in a large corpus this end sentence quite often.\n",
            "  - same thing i can do with the next word after dot.\n",
            "  - you might be able to use any of these features to decide given a particular word is it the end of the sentence or not.\n",
            "  - in hindi you will see that there is only a dunder that you use to indicate the end of the sentence and this is not used for any other purpose.\n",
            "  - my two classes here are end of the sentence and the end of the sentence and what are the observations we were having it might be an abbreviation the case of the word and that it is before the dot may be uppercase or lower case and one of these might indicate one class other might indicate other class.\n",
            "  - we have given this title end of line hyphen.\n",
            "  - what happens in research papers  whenever you write a sentence you might to do some justification and where you end the line even if it is not the end of the word.\n",
            "  - whenever you are given a string you start your pointer at the beginning of the string.\n",
            "  - whenever i have the word w r d i will always write small w r d.  that whenever even if it is starting the sentence and it occurs in capitals because of that  i know that this is a word good w r d but this is not a generic rule.\n",
            "  - if not i see whether the word ends with i s i put it to i ponies goes to ponies.\n"

            "my tokenization is to find out each of the 11 word tokens from the sentence.we said that the tokenization is a process of segmenting a string of characters in two words finding out what are the different words in this issue.this further complicates my problem of word segmentation or segmentation of.i have a set of words w and i do a kleene words here.you see there are two possibilities briath and briam plus that it gives me all the possible ways in which the sentence can be broken into individual word tokens.\n",

            "  - Hello everyone, welcome back to the final lecture of the first week.\n",
            "  - And we saw that the distribution is not very uniform.\n",
            "  - And also how they grow with us to each other.\n",
            "  - So, this you may or may not have to do always and it depends on what is your application.\n",
            "  - So, now you might feel that this is very trivial task, but let us see is it trivial.\n",
            "  - Now, do you think there might be certain challenge involved?\n",
            "  - That is it.\n",
            "  - Doctor, Mr. MPH.\n",
            "  - So, again you have numbers 2.44.3 and so on.\n",
            "  - So, how do we go about solving this.\n",
            "  - So, any data point that I am seeing, I have to divide into one of these two classes.\n",
            "  - So, each point you have to divide into one of the two classes.\n",
            "  - And this in general, this problem in general is called classification problem.\n",
            "  - You are classifying into one of the two classes.\n",
            "  - Now, so the idea is very simple.\n",
            "  - So, you have two classes and each data point you have to divide into one of the two classes.\n",
            "  - So, that means, you have to build some sort of rule of algorithm for doing that.\n",
            "  - So, in this case, I have to build a binary classifier.\n",
            "  - What do I mean by a binary classifier?\n",
            "  - In general, there can be multiple classes.\n",
            "  - So, in general, my classifiers that I will build can be some rules that I write by hand, some simple if-ten-else rules.\n",
            "  - Or I can build a machine learning classifier.\n",
            "  - So, in this particular scenario, what can be the simplest thing to do?\n",
            "  - Let us see, can we build a simple rule-based classifier?\n",
            "  - So, we will start with the example of a simple decision tree.\n",
            "  - So, by decision tree, I mean a set of if-ten-else statements.\n",
            "  - So, I can have this simple if-ten-else kind of decision tree here.\n",
            "  - But, suppose this is a period.\n",
            "  - So, this is very, very simple, if then as rules.\n",
            "  - This may not be correct, but this is one particular way in which this problem can be solved.\n",
            "  - In general, you might want to use some other sort of indications.\n",
            "  - How will it help?\n",
            "  - So, this can be used as another feature.\n",
            "  - So, how will that help?\n",
            "  - So, again this can be used.\n",
            "  - So, I can have some numerical features.\n",
            "  - So, that is I will have certain thresholds.\n",
            "  - Now, so how do we implement it recently?\n",
            "  - So, as you have seen this is a simple if then else statement.\n",
            "  - So, now what is important is that you choose the correct set of features.\n",
            "  - So, now here is one problem suppose I keep on increasing my features this can be both numerical or non-unimegal features.\n",
            "  - It might be difficult to set up my if then else rules by hand.\n",
            "  - So, I will just give you so the names of some of the algorithms and the basic idea on this they work is that so at every point you have to choose a particular split.\n",
            "  - So, you have to choose a feature value that is splits my data into certain parts and I have certain criteria to find out what is the best split.\n",
            "  - So, these algorithms that we have mentioned here like ID3, C415 and C4.\n",
            "  - So, suppose I give you a simple sentence here I have a can opener but I cannot open these cans.\n",
            "  - But in general you can use any of these three possibilities.\n",
            "  - So, one question I have is whether I treated as simple fill land as it is fill lands or I converted to fill lands by removing the first of it.\n",
            "  - So, this question you might also try to defer to the next processing step that we will see.\n",
            "  - But sometimes you might want to tackle this in the same step.\n",
            "  - Now remember when we were talking about some of the cases Y and L page hard.\n",
            "  - So, this problem is related.\n",
            "  - So, this looks again a simple problem but we will see it is not that simple.\n",
            "  - But again this is this is not trivial because for show time you will not do the same show time you might want to keep it as it is.\n",
            "  - But here you are putting it so that it becomes easier to interpret that particular occurrence.\n",
            "  - So, I have this I have this big sentence here.\n",
            "  - So, this problem becomes a bit more severe.\n",
            "  - So, if you try to undo the sun, this is what you will find at the segmented text.\n",
            "  - You put them one after another without making any changes at the boundary.\n",
            "  - Now, what is the simplest algorithm that you can think of?\n",
            "  - So, the simplest algorithm that works is Eglidi algorithm that is called maximum matching algorithm.\n",
            "  - And this works nicely for most of the cases.\n",
            "  - We do not do that, but what is the scenario where we are doing that right now?\n",
            "  - That is what I mean by sigma star here.\n",
            "  - So, W star here.\n",
            "  - So, that is the inverse problem that is whenever I am given a sentence W I have to analyze it by inverting the relations of Sunday.\n",
            "  - So, that is how the segmentarage is segmentarage built.\n",
            "  - Now, this is a snapshot from the segmentar.\n",
            "  - So, I gave the same sentence there and it gave me all the possible ways of analyzing the sentence and it says that there are 120 different solutions.\n",
            "  - So, here whenever I have Brianna.\n",
            "  - So, coming back to normalization.\n",
            "  - If you are only doing the surface level match, you will not be able to map them to each other.\n",
            "  - So, what we are doing by this, we are defining some sort of equivalence class H.\n",
            "  - We also do some sort of case folding that is we can reduce all that as to lower case.\n",
            "  - Sometimes depending on application, you might have certain exceptions.\n",
            "  - So, if you have a entity general model, you might want to keep it as it is without case folding.\n",
            "  - Similarly, you might want to keep u s for United States in upper case and not do the case folding.\n",
            "  - So, again this is some sort of nobulation.\n",
            "  - So, what we are doing here words like automate automatic automation all will be reduced to a single lemma automate here.\n",
            "  - So, you know the actual lemma is automate within e, but here.\n",
            "  - So, I am just chopping off the affixage at that.\n",
            "  - So, I am removing here this I c I o n all and putting it to automate.\n",
            "  - So, this is one example.\n",
            "  - So, we have the portus algorithm that is very very famous and this is again Simpson's set of if the Niles rules.\n",
            "  - So, what is the first step?\n",
            "  - So, walking goes to walk, but what about King?\n",
            "  - So, next week we will start with another Pto Sinsing task that is spilling correction.\n",
            "  - Thank you.\n",
            "\n",
            "🟢 Topic 3:\n",
            "  - So, in the last lecture we were discussing about various empirical laws.\n",
            "  - So, in particular, GIFs law and Heaps law that how the words in the vocabulary are distributed in a corpus.\n",
            "  - And GIFs law gives gave me a relation between the frequency and the rank of a word.\n",
            "  - So, today in this lecture we will start with the basic key processing in language.\n",
            "  - So, we will cover the basic concepts and what are the challenges that one might face while doing the processing.\n",
            "  - So, we are going to the basics of text processing.\n",
            "  - So, for example, suppose you are doing classification for the whole document into certain classage.\n",
            "  - You might not have to go to the individual sentence and you can just talk about what are various words that are present in this document.\n",
            "  - On the other hand, suppose you are trying to find out what are the important sentences in this document.\n",
            "  - In that application you will have to go to the individual sentence.\n",
            "  - We call them as various features.\n",
            "  - They are various observations that you make from your corpus.\n",
            "  - So, what are some examples?\n",
            "  - What can be some other features?\n",
            "  - Now, we will see some of the examples in the same lecture.\n",
            "  - So, how do you go about choosing the set of features?\n",
            "  - You will see in your from your data what are some observations that can separate my two classes here.\n",
            "  - So, all these are my observations that I use as my features.\n",
            "  - So, in that scenario I can try to use some sort of machine learning technique to learn this dictionary in the literature there are lot of such algorithms that are available that give any data and a set of features will consider a dictionary for you.\n",
            "  - So, one particular criteria is what is the information gain by this.\n",
            "  - They all use one of these criteria.\n",
            "  - In general once you identify what are your interesting features for this task you are not limited to only one classifier like dictionary.\n",
            "  - You can also try out some other classifiers like support vector machines, large regression and neural networks.\n",
            "  - All these are quite popular classifiers for various NLP applications.\n",
            "  - So, we will talk about some of these as we will go to some some advanced topics in this course.\n",
            "  - In practice at least for English you can use certain tool kits that are available like analytic in Python, coronal pin Java and you can also use some unique commands.\n",
            "  - So, in this course we will mainly be using analytic toolkit for doing all these pre-tastic task and some other tasks as well.\n",
            "  - So, for example, here you will see that I if I encounter a word like fill lands in my data.\n",
            "  - So, now they are no fixed answers to these and some of these might depend on what is the application for which you are doing this pre processing.\n",
            "  - But one thing you can always keep in mind suppose you are doing it for the application of information tree well the same sort of steps that you apply for your documents should be applied to your query as well otherwise you will not be able to match them perfectly.\n",
            "  - So, suppose if I am using it for information tree well so I should use the same convention for both my documents as well as the query.\n",
            "  - So, here I have a sentence from a research paper abstract and the sentence says this paper describes mimic an adaptive mixed initiative spoken dialogue system that provides movie show time information.\n",
            "  - So, does do hashtags come into mind?\n",
            "  - So, for example, suppose I have hashtags like thank you searching in music Monday.\n",
            "  - So, if you are given a hashtag and you have to analyze that, you have to actually segment it into various words.\n",
            "  - But my problem is how do I analyze them?\n",
            "  - Now, I should be able to match them together, especially if you are doing information retrieval, you are giving a query and you are retrieving from some document.\n",
            "  - So, that so you will have to consider this problem in advance and do the pre-versus in accordingly of either your documents or the query, but using the same sort same settings.\n",
            "  - So, we will discuss in detail about it in morphology later.\n",
            "  - So, what are some examples here.\n",
            "  - If you want to match the query with the documents, so this is for this week.\n",
            "\n",
            "🟢 Topic 1:\n",
            "  - There are certain words that are very, very common.\n",
            "  - And on the other hand, there are 50 percent of the words in the vocabulary that occur only once.\n",
            "  - Now, I need to identify what are all the different words that are there in this sequence.\n",
            "  - So, I am trying to segment it by the various words that I am observing.\n",
            "  - Or it can be some expressions, I say if my particular example matches with this sexual expression, it is one plus, if it does not match, it is another class.\n",
            "  - So, my 3 can be if the length of the word is between 5 to 7 I go to one class otherwise I go to another class.\n",
            "  - If you count there are 11 different words 11 different words 11 different occurrences of words.\n",
            "  - So, you will find there are only 10 unique words which word repeats say the word I repeats twice.\n",
            "  - So, then another problem can be how do I handle hyphens in my data.\n",
            "  - So, let us see some kind of examples what are the various sorts of hyphens that can be there in my corpus.\n",
            "  - So, in the sentence itself you see two different hyphens one is with initiative initiative another is show hyphen time.\n",
            "  - So, now can you see that these two are different hyphens the first hyphen is not in general that I will I will use in my text.\n",
            "  - Second hyphen I can use in my text I can write show time within hyphen but how did this hyphen initiative came into the corpus.\n",
            "  - So, we have given this title end of line hyphen.\n",
            "  - So, you will end up within hyphen.\n",
            "  - So, now when you are trying to pre process and when you are retrieving such kind of hyphens you might have to join these together and you say you have to say that this is single word initiative and not initiate hyphen tape.\n",
            "  - Then there are some other kind of hyphens like lexical hyphens.\n",
            "  - So, you might have these hyphens with various prefixes like copie, meta, multi, etcetera.\n",
            "  - Sometimes they are sententially determined hyphens also that is you put hyphens so that it becomes easier to interpret the sentence like here case paste, handle evoked, etcetera are optional.\n",
            "  - Similarly, if you see in the next sentence 3 to 5 year direct marketing plan 3 to 5 year can be written perfectly without keeping the hyphens.\n",
            "  - But the problem is that this is not a single word.\n",
            "  - This is a term bound composed of four different words and the corresponding English meaning is this one.\n",
            "  - So, you have four words in English when you are putting in French they make a compound.\n",
            "  - So, you might want to find out what are the individual words in this particular compound.\n",
            "  - So, you need some sort of compound splitter for German.\n",
            "  - This is a proverb and this is a single sentence that talks about this proverb, but where all the words are combined with some relation.\n",
            "  - So, there are multiple words in this sentence, they are combined to make a single, it looks like a single word.\n",
            "  - So, in Japanese and in Chinese, when you try to combine various words together, you simply concatenate them.\n",
            "  - When you combine two words, you also make certain changes at the boundary and this is called a Sanda operation.\n",
            "  - Now, suppose that you have the dictionary and the words that you are that you are currently seeing all should be in the dictionary.\n",
            "  - So, this griddle chooses what are the actual words by taking the maximum match.\n",
            "  - In English in general we do not combine words to make a single word.\n",

            "  - And I am saying together with a proof that is a formal way of saying that, but what I mean is that W 1 to W n when I they combine by Sunday operation they give me the actual sentence, the initial sentence.\n",

            "  - We also have the problem of lamtaization that is you have individual words like m r is and you want to convert them to their lemma.\n",
            "  - That means what is the base form from this they are derived.\n",
            "  - Similarly, car, cars, cars, cars, so all these are derived from car.\n",
            "  - You are saying all these are some sort of equivalence class because they come from the same word form.\n",
            "  - So, in the problem of lamtaization is that you have to find out the actual dictionary head word from this they are derived and for that we use morphology.\n",
            "  - So, what is morphology?\n",
            "  - I am trying to find out the structure of a word by seeing what is the perqueous stem, the head word and what is the affix that I apply to it.\n",
            "  - So, these individual units are called various morphim.\n",
            "  - So, you have which stems that are the the originally head words and the affix is that are what are the different units like as for plural etcetera you are applying to them to make the individual word.\n",
            "  - So, there is another concept you have lamtaization where you are finding the actual dictionary head word.\n",
            "  - So, this is also concept called stemming where you do not try to find the actual dictionary head word, but you just try to remove certain suffixage and you or whatever you obtain is called stem.\n",
            "  - So, this is a crude chopping of various suffixage in that word.\n",
            "  - So, this is stemming.\n",

            "  - So, we saw that roughly 100 words in the vocabulary make for 50 percent of the corpus, but by that I mean that number of tokens.\n",
            "  - And we discussed what are the various relationships among the vocabulary size and the number of tokens that I observe in a corpus.\n",
            "  - So, we will start with the problem of tokenization.\n",
            "  - As the name would suggest remember the name token, token is an individual word in my corpus.\n",
            "  - What I will face is a string of characters, the sequence of characters.\n",
            "  - So, tokenization is the process by which I convert the string of characters into sequence of various words.\n",
            "  - So, now before going into what is tokenization, I will just talk about a slightly related problem sentence segmentation.\n",
            "  - So, now if you have to go to the individual sentence, the first task that you will face is how do I segment this whole document into a sequence of sentences.\n",
            "  - So, this is sentence one sentence two and so on and this task is called sentence segmentation.\n",
            "  - So, what is sentence segmentation?\n",
            "  - So, in text processing, if we face this kind of problem in nearly every simple task that we are doing.\n",
            "  - Now, whenever I am using a numerical features like the length of the word before dot I need to pick some sort of threshold that is whether the length of the word is between 2 to 3 or say more than 3 between 5 to 7 like that.\n",
            "  - Now, coming back to a problem of tokenization.\n",
            "  - We said that the tokenization is a process of segmenting a string of characters in two words finding out what are the different words in this issue.\n",
            "  - Now, remember we talked about token and type distinction.\n",
            "  - How many tokens are there?\n",
            "  - So, you have 11 word tokens but how many unique words are there.\n",
            "  - So, there are 10 types and 11 tokens.\n",
            "  - So, my tokenization is to find out each of the 11 word tokens from the sentence.\n",
            "  - So, for English most of the problems that we will see are taking care of by the token areas that we have discussed previously.\n",
            "  - But still it is good to know what are the challenges that are involved when I have tried to design a tokenization algorithm.\n",
            "  - Similarly, if you see what are do I treated as a single token or two tokens what are this problem you might have to solve in the same step whether I treated as a single token or multiple tokens same with I am shouldn't and so on.\n",
            "  - Similarly, whenever we have named and it is like San Francisco should I treated as a single token or two separate tokens.\n",
            "  - So, you might have to find out this particular sequence of tokens is a single entity and treated as a single entity not as multiple different tokens.\n",
            "  - Similarly, if you find m dot p dot h do you call it a single token or multiple tokens.\n",
            "  - So, again when you are doing tokenization you have problem at how do I handle all these hyphens.\n",
            "  - So, for example is like in French if you have a token like lunch ensemble so you might want to match it with ensemble.\n",
            "  - So, now what is the problem that you will face when you are processing the German text and you are trying to tokenize it.\n",
            "  - So, now when you are doing the prefossessing your task is to find out what are the individual words tokens in this Chinese sentence.\n",
            "  - So, this problem is also difficult because in general for a given utterance of a sequence of characters they might be more than one possible ways of breaking into sequence of words and both might be perfectly valid possibilities.\n",
            "  - So, in Chinese we do not have any space between words and have to find out what are the places where I have to break these words and this problem is called tokenization word tokenization.\n",
            "  - So, this further complicates my problem of word segmentation or segmentation of.\n",
            "  - So, now when I talk about this problem of tokenization in Sanskrit or in English this problem is also called word segmentation.\n",
            "  - I have a sequence of characters and you segment it to find out individual words.\n",
            "  - So, whenever you are given a string, you start your pointer at the beginning of the string.\n",
            "  - So, you will find out what is the maximum match as per my dictionary in the string, you break there and put the pointer from at the next correct and again do the same thing.\n",
            "  - Now, so this silly iteration, now can you think of some cases where the segmentation will also be required for English text?\n",
            "  - Now, from this finite alphabet I can generate a lot of words that are composed of various number of phonemes or letters from this alphabet.\n",
            "  - So, you see there are two possibilities, Briath and Briam plus now like that it gives me all the possible ways in which the sentence can be broken into individual word tokens.\n",
            "  - Now, this is another problem that I will have to find out what is the most likely word sequence among all these 120 possibilities, but we can use many many different models that we will not talk about in this lecture, probably in some some other lectures.\n",

            "  - Can I use this as a feature whether my word starts within uppercase, lowercase, cap, all caps, all is in number.\n",
            "  - So, again by feature you can think of a simple rule whether the word I am currently at is a number or I can use the fact where the case of the word with dot is uppercase or lowercase.\n",
            "  - So, what happens generally in abbreviations?\n",
            "  - We are mostly in uppercase.\n",
            "  - So, suppose I have doctor and it starts with an uppercase, I can say that this might be an abbreviation.\n",
            "  - Same with lowercase, lowercase will give me more probability that this is not an abbreviation.\n",
            "  - Similarly, I can also use the case of the word after dot.\n",

            "  - So, if some of you have taken Sanskrit course in your class 8th or 10th.\n",
            "  - So, you might be familiar with the rules of Sanskrit language.\n",
            "  - So, let us say this is a simple single sentence in Sanskrit, but this is a huge, this looks like a simple word, but it is not a single word.\n",
            "  - It is composed of multiple words in Sanskrit and they are combined with this on the relation.\n",
            "  - This stands for a nice proverb in Sanskrit that translation English as one should tell the truth, one should say kind words, one should neither tell harsh truth, not flatly flattening lies, this is a rule for all times.\n",
            "  - So, this problem is so in Chinese, Japanese and Sanskrit, but in Sanskrit, the problem is slightly more complicated and why is that?\n",
            "  - It does not happen in Sanskrit.\n",
            "  - So, in this particular case, you see here I have the word Briyath and the word Na, but when I am combining, I am writing it Briyana.\n",
            "  - So, you see here the letter T gets changed to N.\n",

            "  - And this is important for the application of machine translation also because if you do a case folding here, you will know u s in lower case that means something else was such u s that is in United States.\n",
